Jenkins is a CI/CD tool whihc is platform independent
when different developers are working on a software and make changes to the source code. A bug could occur 
and it might be pretty difficult to find bug as you would have to check all coudes added that day
jenkins helps isolate and know when a bug is introduced. As soon a code is commited jenkins takes the code and 
builds it. a status report is also sent and we can know if it was built successfully or not
we can also integrate a unit test or integrated test
-jenkins check the repositries at intervals for any changes. It detects the chabges, pulls these changes and start
the build proces, if it fails the dev team would be notified. if successful, jenkisn deploy build in the server
